Cabbage and mustard lentils are staples within Ethiopian spreads, with no shortage of bright flavors from turmeric, cumin and chile."

        description: "Made with tender, boneless leg of lamb, this quick-cooking staple of Ethiopian home cooking is called awaze tibs and is flavored with awaze sauce, a kicky blend of berbere spices, smoked paprika, lemon juice and wine. Some cooks like it dry, but Hiyaw Gebreyohannes prefers it saucy—all the better for mopping up with Ethiopia's crêpe-like bread, injera."

        description: "Cooking onions until softened, then stirring in spices and aromatics like garlic and ginger is the foundation of many Ethiopian recipes, from vegetables and lentils to meat and chicken. In this delicately spiced vegetarian dish, chunks of carrots and cabbage are added to the base and cooked until the cabbage is sweet and silky. Turmeric, the main seasoning, lends an earthy flavor."
